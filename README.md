# GIF Museum

An example of using Google's ARCore in Kotlin. It detects certain images from 2 GIFs (Gandalf and the trampoline dog) in the real world and overlays the actual looping animation on the image. Imagine walking through a museum gallery of screenshots, pointing your phone at one, and seeing it play the full GIF.
